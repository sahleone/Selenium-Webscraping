The world's largest banks, healthcare organizations, hedge funds and law firms all use Tessian to secure their email environments, data and people whilst saving their security team time.

Takes responsibility for delivering large projects that require collaboration from start to finish
Has strong listening skills; open to input from other team members and departments
Has worked with, or understands the principles behind working with data at scale




Our mission to empower and protect people is a reflection of two of our values: Human First and We Do the Right Thing. For us, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion is also a reflection of these core values. 
 
As a human first company, we are committed to creating a diverse, equitable and inclusive environment where all our Tessians have the opportunity to thrive. We strive for a better Tessian, and a better world. We're working inside and outside Tessian to improve diversity and equity in our industry, and foster an environment where everyone feels a sense of belonging.
 
Our strategy touches each part of a Tessian’s life cycle, from applicant to employee, ensuring that we keep DEI at the core of every point in our candidate and employee experience. Read more about our DEI commitments here.

Our mission to empower and protect people is a reflection of two of our values: Human First and We Do the Right Thing. For us, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion is also a reflection of these core values. 
 
As a human first company, we are committed to creating a diverse, equitable and inclusive environment where all our Tessians have the opportunity to thrive. We strive for a better Tessian, and a better world. We're working inside and outside Tessian to improve diversity and equity in our industry, and foster an environment where everyone feels a sense of belonging.

Our Analytics team work closely with the customer during the system integration to ensure high-quality data is integrated and that the ARIC system is correctly configured to meet the fraud detection demands on the customer.
Analytics and risk strategy consultancy: No analytics execution platform supplied by high-quality, clean data is better than the specific analytics that it runs! Our team work extremely closely with customer fraud and risk strategy teams to ensure that the analytics that our systems run produce industry-leading fraud detection outcomes. We do this by supporting and teaching our customers to use our system effectively but also lending our experience from across the industry and querying data sent to the platform to further optimise the analytics.
Data science: Featurespace’s machine learning models are one of the most attractive propositions to our customers! The final piece in the triad of team activities is the configuration of machine learning models from the rich datasets our customers possess.

You will lead a team working across these three tasks, helping deliver success on behalf of our customers by:

Line managing a team in Analytics, acting as both a leader able to spell out a strategic vision and a mentor who grows team members to realise that vision
Managing complex deliveries of real-time machine learning models and rules-based systems in a way that builds good relationships with key customer stakeholders
Providing consulting expertise to customers that addresses their challenges and demonstrates the value of what we offer
Dealing with large data sets and noisy information on complex projects and translating business requirements into well-defined and actionable tasks
Managing client teams, and helping to accelerate critical work, including by identifying risks and empowering team members to unblock work before challenges arise
Improving internal processes, both operational and technical, in a way that enables scalable work tracking and continual improvement in all responsibility areas, including recruitment, resourcing, and training
Be a senior point of knowledge and escalation of analytics related technical questions





About you

 
Must haves:

Depth of experience in stakeholder management and managing customer expectations and common challenges
Ability to manage and prioritise changeable workload ensuring internal and external deadlines are met.
Experience working with customers to gather complex sets of requirements including analytical system design, data integration design, and model design
Knowledge of Python and familiarity with SQL

Experience with software engineering, version control, and the Unix command line
Practical experience of the handling and mining of large, diverse, data sets
Industry experience in financial services, fraud, and fraud strategy
Basic knowledge of event-driven systems and distributed computing for stateful systems
Experience managing and developing high performing individuals

Job Description


As a Lead Data Scientist, you will play a crucial role in ensuring success for our customers by leading a team delivering the analytical capabilities that are at the heart of our mission to make the world a safer place to transact.
At Featurespace, we produce state-of-the-art machine learning models and decision systems protecting banks, payment providers, and hundreds of millions of cardholders and accountholders from fraud and financial crime every day.
We do this by providing our customers with an analytics execution platform, ARIC, which responds in real-time to stop transaction and payment fraud in its tracks. The platform also enables our customers’ fraud and risk operations teams to review high-risk and suspicious activities identified by their analytics, orchestrate communication with their account and cardholders, and track closely the effectiveness of those analytics and operations.
Our Analytics team are based across both our Cambridge and London offices – this is a hybrid role so you will ideally be comfortable coming into one or other of the offices around twice a week. If you’re interested in the role but require more flexibility, please speak to us!

01-03-2024,"Senior Data Scientist, Forecasting",Klaviyo,Accel,"Boston, MA, US",https://www.ventureloop.com/ventureloop/jobdetail.php?jobid=2625582&hc=klaviyo&jt=senior-data-scientist-forecasting,"
Job Description


 At Klaviyo, we value the unique backgrounds, experiences and perspectives each Klaviyo (we call ourselves Klaviyos) brings to our workplace each and every day. We believe everyone deserves a fair shot at success and appreciate the experiences each person brings beyond the traditional job requirements. If you’re a close but not exact match with the description, we hope you’ll still consider applying. Want to learn more about life at Klaviyo? Visit  careers.klaviyo.com  to see how we empower creators to own their own destiny. 

 About the team: 
 Our team is the dedicated data science resource for areas outside of R&D, such as Customer Success, Sales, and Finance. One of our key technical areas is forecasting, which helps our internal teams plan and informs our guidance to external investors.  
 Listen to our data science team podcast at  https://medium.com/klaviyo-data-science  and learn more about our technical culture at  https://klaviyo.tech    
 About the role: 
 As a Senior Data Scientist, you will be a technical co-owner of the data science forecasting system at Klaviyo. One of Klaviyo’s core values is ownership—the ability to bias toward action, think one step ahead of problems you might face, and generally just get things done—and this role is a shining example. The solutions you deliver and research you complete for the forecasting system will directly contribute to our go-to-market teams meeting their revenue, churn, and sales goals, as well as helping us meet our fiduciary duty as a public company to deliver the best guidance we can to our public investors.  
 The ideal candidate has a strong background in data science, statistics, and machine learning, with a heavy emphasis on forecasting, time series analysis, time-to-event data, and similar methods and tools. We’re looking for someone who can build, train, and deploy models, work directly with both technical and non-technical stakeholders to scope projects and adjust to new information on the fly, and learn about the areas they work in deeply enough to become an expert but quickly enough to deliver timely solutions. As a technical co-owner of the forecasting system, you will be expected to be able to speak about your technical solutions to stakeholders within the business, so communication skills are essential. We’re especially interested in candidates who, in addition to their forecasting background, have experience working directly with business stakeholders in fields such as customer success, finance, and sales, but that experience is not required. 
 You should have experience building models that are used by people to make better decisions and used by organizations to drive key outcomes. We prefer iterative solutions that are incrementally better to a long-debated “perfect” solution. 
 As a Senior Data Scientist, you’ll also have a strong role in mentoring other members of the team. You’ll review their math and statistics work as well as their code to ensure high quality, and you’ll share your knowledge with the team to help others learn. 
 How you’ll have an impact: 

 Co-own a strategically crucial and high-impact technical area 
 Work directly with stakeholders across the business to understand business problems and scope data science projects that will solve those problems 
 Conduct research, build models, and ship solutions that make our forecasting system better, more reliable, and more user-friendly 
 Choose the right solution for the problem at hand rather than relying on “one-size-fits-all” approaches 
 Mentor team members through statistical and code reviews, helping them learn best practices and level up their own skills 

 What we’re looking for: 

 Strong fundamental understanding and deep experience with a variety of statistical and/or machine learning algorithms (e.g. regression models, tree-based methods, large language models, clustering, neural networks) as well as ways to evaluate and validate the performance of those models, with an emphasis on forecasting, time series analysis, time-to-event data, and similar approaches 
 Experience working with stakeholders directly during the course of a project and managing stakeholder relationships 
 Ability to write clean, intelligible code in Python, including experience with data science tools and packages 
 5+ years professional industry data science experience 
 Bachelor’s or advanced degree in statistics, applied mathematics, computer science or other relevant quantitative discipline, or equivalent industry experience 

 Nice to have: 

 Enjoys the high-risk research aspect of data science, i.e. capable and excited to learn from null or negative results and iterate to a better solution 
 Demonstrated a measurable and sizeable impact with your data science work 
 Strong experience analyzing data and making rigorous statements about what can or cannot be concluded

Job Description

We’re here to make money work for everyone and we're doing things differently. For too long, banking has been obtuse, complex and opaque.
We want to change that and build a bank with everyone, for everyone. Our amazing community suggests features, test the app and give us constant feedback so we can build something everyone loves.
We're focused on solving problems, rather than selling financial products. We want to make the world a better place and change people's lives through Monzo.
About our Data Science Team:
We're looking for a Data Scientist for our Operations team excited to help build the bank of the future. You'll have the opportunity to work on an area that is the heart of how we enchant our customers and is full of data challenges: from optimising our systems, to experimenting with different app flows and working closely with Ops managers to understand the biggest opportunities for serving our customers.
At Monzo, we're building a bank that is fair, transparent and a delight to use. We’re growing extremely fast and have over four and half million customers in the UK, with over 100,000 new people joining every month. We’ve built a product that people love and more than 80% of our growth comes from word of mouth and referrals. Our Product Analytics team's mission is to
Enable Monzo to Make Better Decisions, Faster
We have a strong culture of data-driven decision making across the whole company. And we're great believers in powerful, real-time analytics and empowerment of the wider business. All our data lives in one place and is super easy to use. 90% of day-to-day data-driven decisions are covered by self-serve analytics through Looker which gives data scientists the head space to focus on more impactful business questions and analyses.
We work in cross-functional squads where every data scientist is a member of a central data discipline and either embedded directly in a product squad or working closely with the operations leadership team.
Your day-to-day   

Guide and enable product teams to measure things that matter; design and analyse  A/B experiments to keep improving everything we do; offer actionable recommendations to stakeholders
Apply your expertise in quantitative analysis, data mining, and the presentation of data to see beyond the numbers and understand how our users interact with our products and how those insights can inform our product strategy
Help us understand how we can measure and optimise a system that handles thousands of queries a week. What product improvements can we make? How can we understand if these are impactful?
Liaise with engineers to keep making sure we collect the right data to produce relevant business insights

You should apply if:
What we’re doing here at Monzo excites you!

You're impact driven and eager to have a real positive impact on the company, product, users and very importantly your colleagues as well
You're commercially minded and can put numbers into business perspective
You’re as comfortable getting hands-on as taking a step back and thinking strategically
You have a self-starter mindset; you proactively identify issues and opportunities and tackle them without being told to do so
You're a team player whom your colleagues can rely on
You have solid grounding in SQL and preferably Python
You have experience in conducting large scale A/B experiments

The Interview Process:
Our interview process involves three main stages: 

Initial Call 
Take home task

Roles with only a city location are eligible for in-office or hybrid office work in that city. Our talent team will work with candidates to determine what locations and roles are eligible for each option.
